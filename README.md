Airlines Loyalty Program Power BI Project Report

The Airlines Loyalty Program project involved a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and performance metrics. The steps taken to generate insights and the resulting dashboard can be summarized as follows:

1.	Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
•	Loaded three tables (Customer, Flight Activity, Loyalty History, Calendar) into Power BI.
•	Verified data types, checked for missing values, and examined the dataset structure.

2.	Data Model and Relationships.
•	Created relationships between tables based on relevant fields.
•	Ensured relationships were correctly defined to facilitate analysis.

3.	Basic Visualizations:
•	Developed a bar chart to show the total number of flights booked each year.
•	Included a slicer for users to filter data by year.

4.	Customer Segmentation:
•	Utilized the CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) field to segment customers into categories (high-value, medium-value, low-value).
•	Created visuals to represent customer segments.

5.	Geographical Analysis:
•	Developed a map visualization to showcase customer distribution across countries and provinces.

6.	Loyalty Card Analysis:
•	Visualized customer distribution based on loyalty card status (Star, Nova, Aurora).
•	Calculated the average CLV for each loyalty card status.

7.	Enrollment Analysis:
•	Created a line chart to show enrollments over the years.
•	Analyzed trends and identified peak enrollment periods.

8.	Cancellation Analysis:
•	Developed visuals to show cancellations over the years.
•	Analyzed reasons for cancellations and their impact on CLV.

9.	Flight Distance and Points Analysis:
•	Investigated the correlation between flight distance and loyalty points accumulated.
•	Created a scatter plot to visualize this relationship.

10.	Monthly Revenue Analysis:
•	Calculated monthly revenue by multiplying total flights and dollar cost points redeemed.
11.	Customer Demographics Analysis:
•	Developed visuals to analyze customer distribution based on gender, education, and marital status.

12.	Dashboard Creation:
•	Combined visuals into an interactive and cohesive dashboard.
•	Added slicers and filters for enhanced user interaction.

13.	Final Review and Documentation:
•	Conducted a final review of the Power BI solution for accuracy and completeness.
•	Documented key insights, findings, and challenges faced during the analysis.

This comprehensive approach ensured a thorough analysis and provided actionable insights into the Airlines Loyalty Program.
